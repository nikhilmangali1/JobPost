# JobPost

Project: Job Posting Web Application
Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, REST API, Maven

Developed a full-stack job posting web application using Spring Boot. Implemented RESTful endpoints to allow users to create, read, update, and delete job listings. Designed and structured the application using the MVC architecture, integrating a service layer for business logic and a repository layer with Spring Data JPA for data persistence. Ensured modularity and scalability by separating concerns and leveraging dependency injection. Followed best practices for project structure and used Maven for build automation.
