Developed a web-based job posting application using Spring Boot and JSP for server-side rendering. Designed the application using the MVC architecture, incorporating a service and repository layer to simulate data handling. Although no database was integrated, Spring Data JPA annotations were used to structure the application for future scalability. RESTful endpoints support basic CRUD operations, and JSP views handle user interaction. Maven was used for build automation.
